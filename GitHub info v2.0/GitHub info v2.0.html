<p>Today, <a hreg="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is one of the most popular resources for developers to share code and work on projects together.<br> It’s free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software.<br> If this all sounds like something you should know, read on — we’ll explain what GitHub is, what it's used for, and how to get started. So keep reading, or click one of the links below to jump to the section you're looking for:</p>

<h1>How does GitHub work?</h1>
<p>GitHub users create accounts, upload files, and create coding projects. But the real work of GitHub happens when users begin to collaborate.<br> While anyone can code independently, teams of people build most development projects. Sometimes these teams are all in one place at once time, but more often they work asynchronously.<br> There are many challenges to creating collaborative projects with distributed teams.<br> GitHub makes this process much simpler in a few different ways.</p>

<p><b>First, all the code and documentation are in one place. This limits issues with access for anyone who wants to contribute to a project. Each repository also contains instructions and other details to help outline project goals and rules.</b></p>
<p><b>Next, coding is more creative and abstract than most non-technical people think it is. For example, say two devs are working on different pieces of code. These two pieces of code should work together. But sometimes one piece of code can make the other code fail.<br> Or a piece of code can have an unexpected impact on how the other code works.</b></p>
<p><b>GitHub solves these problems by showing how both files will change the main branch.<br> It catches these errors before pushing changes, making the coding process more efficient.</b></p>
<p><b>GitHub also makes it easier to track changes and go back to previous versions of a project.<br> To explain this, we’ll need to understand the technology that GitHub is based on, Git, and talk about version control.</b></p>

<h2>What is Git?</h2>
<p><i>Git is open-source version control software, used for managing and tracking file revisions.<br> You can use Git with any file type, but it’s most often used for tracking code files.</i></p>
